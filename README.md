# PersonalizedCommands_Part2
Program in C
This is the second part of personalized commands in C. We had to rescue what we did in the first part but modify the project into making them do a ping to two different DNS directions, then analyze which one was faster, and if one of them was faster than the one in current use, make it change it for the fastest.
